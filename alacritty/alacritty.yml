# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# Import additional configuration files
#
# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing
# file being loaded last. If a field is already present in a previous import, it
# will be replaced.
#
# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative
# to the user's home directory starting with `~/`.
#import:
#  - /path/to/alacritty.yml
# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
#env:
# TERM variable
#
# This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
# each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
# check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
# available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
#TERM: alacritty
window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Number of lines/columns (not pixels) in the terminal. Both lines and columns
  # must be non-zero for this to take effect. The number of columns must be at
  # least `2`, while using a value of `0` for columns and lines will fall back
  # to the window manager's recommended size
  #dimensions:
  #  columns: 0

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  #padding:
  #  x: 0
  #  y: 0
  # Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content.
  #dynamic_padding: false
  # Window decorations

  #     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
  #     - buttonless: Title bar, transparent background and no title bar buttons
  #decorations: full
  # Background opacity
  #
  # Window opacity as a floating point number from `0.0` to `1.0`.
  # The value `0.0` is completely transparent and `1.0` is opaque.

  #class:
  # Application instance name
  #instance: Alacritty
  # General application class
  #general: Alacritty
  # Decorations theme variant (Linux/BSD only)
  #
  # Override the variant of the GTK theme/Wayland client side decorations.
  # Commonly supported values are `dark` and `light`. Set this to `None` to use
  # the default theme variant.
  #decorations_theme_variant: None
  #scrolling:

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought
  # of as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter
  # spacing.
  #offset:
  #  x: 0
